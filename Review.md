#
- Preparation
    - The list of all bin identifiers is iterated:
        - Assign a numbered vertex {access_location_id} representing the location this bin can be accessed from.
    - Manually define a list of edges between {access_location_id} pairs.
- Dijkstra: Populate Paths & Distances
    - Given a graph containing all {access_location_id}s:
    - Every {access_location_id} will have a shortest path calculated to every other {access_location_id}.
        - `PathFinder::getShortestPath( int $source, int $sink )`
    - Resulting Data:
        - `$paths[$source_access_location_id][$destination_access_location_id] = [{...access_location_id}]`
        - Not necessary, used for quicker lookups later:
            - `$distances[$source_access_location_id][$destination_access_location_id] = count($paths[$source_access_location_id][$destination_access_location_id])`
- Path Finding
    - Start at an arbitrary point {start}.
    - Until all bins have been iterated {iteration A}:
        - Find the nearest bin:
            - Given a source bin identifier:
            - Look up the associated {access_location_id}.
            - The list of all unvisited (not yet returned as a nearest bin) bin identifiers is iterated:
                - Look up the associated {access_location_id}.
                - Look up the path between the source {access_location_id} and destination {access_location_id} in `$paths`.
            - Return the unvisited bin with the shortest path.
        - Add the path to this nearest bin to the full path.
    - Add the path to the {start} location to the full path.
- Discussion
    - Warehouse Layout & Edges manually specified
    - Really total shortest path?
        - Point-to-point distances are, but the main bin loop goes one by one to nearest.
